# Bru's Mind Serialization Project

Lots of people, me included, would love to believe our ideas are consistent,
definite, and unbiased. However, that's hardly the case, for many reasons:
* We construct our world views through a mixture of experience and information.
  Both of those are always subjected to a non-zero degree of lack of knowledge,
  so that we can't (or rather, shouldn't) attribute an absolutely certain value
  of truth to the things we believe in.
  Instead, we must work with [plausible reasoning](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6P1rjJuD_M
  ), so our ideas aren't definite.
* [We don't rewire our whole brain](
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFv5DvrLDCg
  ) each time new information arrives. This would be so mentally demanding and,
  for evolutive purposes, not necessarily benefical.
* I'd hope this would be needless to say, but it isn't:
  We have [a thousand biases](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
  ).

However, some of us do make an effort to reduce those (hopefully) undesirable
qualities. To this end, I decided to try to slowly write down my worldview,
including morals and whatnot and, while I'm at it, maybe throw some ideas,
insights, or questions that may hopefully appeal to someone. That's the purpose
of this repo.

Welcome to Bru's Mind Serialization Project! I hope we all have a safe trip.
