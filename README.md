# Bru's Mind Serialization Project

Lots of people, me included, would love to believe our ideas are consistent,
definite, and unbiased. However, that's hardly the case, for many reasons:
* We construct our world views through a mixture of experience and information.
  Both of those are always subjected to a non-zero degree of lack of knowledge,
  so that we can't (or rather, shouldn't) attribute an absolutely certain value
  of truth to the things we believe in.
  Instead, we must work with [plausible reasoning](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6P1rjJuD_M
  ), so our ideas aren't definite.
* [We don't rewire our whole brain](
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFv5DvrLDCg
  ) each time new information arrives. This would be so mentally demanding and,
  for evolutive purposes, not necessarily benefical.
* I'd hope this would be needless to say, but it isn't:
  We have [hundreds of biases](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
  ).

However, some of us do make an effort to reduce those (hopefully) undesirable
qualities. To this end, I decided to try to slowly write down my worldview,
including morals and whatnot and, while I'm at it, maybe throw some ideas,
insights, or questions that may hopefully appeal to someone. That's the purpose
of this repo.

This README shall contain a list of assertions and, when needed, a quantifier of
my degree of belief in them. I shall make an effort of being explicit with
dependencies, so that it is clear whenever I think a certain position can be
deduced from previous ones.

Welcome to Bru's Mind Serialization Project! I hope we all have a safe trip.

## Beliefs

### Axiom 1: There is a working mechanism to the universe that is unchangeable by any of its parts.

A good example of such a situation would be if the universe was completely
defined by a Newtonian model. It would be defined by Newton's laws, say, “Force
equals mass times acceleration, ...” and a set of interaction terms that defined
what the forces applying onto any of those particles would be. It would thus
follow, by definition, that none of its particles would have a say on what
really happens to them.

Now, the universe sure as hell doesn't follow Newtonian mechanics. But [we do
have pretty successful models for reality](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model
). And however faulty they may be (at unfathomably high resolution), it doesn't
change the fact that they do limit what we can say happens. We can't say a
planet isn't orbiting the sun. We can't say dopamine doesn't do what we know it
does do.

### Consequence 2: Human behaviour is ultimately deterministic.

#### From [axiom 1](#axiom-1-there-is-a-working-mechanism-to-the-universe-that-is-unchangeable-by-any-of-its-parts)

Whatever rules they be. Electrons do as electrons do, and there's no sense to
claiming otherwise. And we, humans, aren't an exception. We may be complex, hard
to model or predict, but we aren't above it all, and there's always a mechanism
behind us doing as we do.

### Nuance 3: We have some degree of control

#### Nuance at [consequence 2](#consequence-2-human-behaviour-is-ultimately-deterministic)

It is important to note however that, in a sense, we do have control over
ourselves. Our brains, as a physical system, are strongly linked to what happens
to us as a whole. They are influenced by our environment, and they influence it
back. What's more, it has a very noticeable degree of self maleability, meaning
we are able to change habits and react to changes in our world views.
