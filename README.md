# Bru's Mind Serialization Project

Lots of people, me included, would love to believe our ideas are consistent,
definite, and unbiased. However, that's hardly the case, for many reasons:
* We construct our world views through a mixture of experience and information.
  Both of those are always subjected to a non-zero degree of lack of knowledge,
  so that we can't (or rather, shouldn't) attribute an absolutely certain value
  of truth to the things we believe in.
  Instead, we must work with [plausible reasoning](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6P1rjJuD_M
  ), so our ideas aren't definite.
* [We don't rewire our whole brain](
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFv5DvrLDCg
  ) each time new information arrives. This would be so mentally demanding and,
  for evolutive purposes, not necessarily benefical.
* I'd hope this would be needless to say, but it isn't:
  We have [hundreds of biases](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
  ).

However, some of us do make an effort to reduce those (hopefully) undesirable
qualities. To this end, I decided to try to slowly write down my worldview,
including morals and whatnot and, while I'm at it, maybe throw some ideas,
insights, or questions that may hopefully appeal to someone. That's the purpose
of this repo.

This README shall contain a list of assertions and, when needed, a quantifier of
my degree of belief in them. I shall make an effort of being explicit with
dependencies, so that it is clear whenever I think a certain position can be
deduced from previous ones.

Welcome to Bru's Mind Serialization Project! I hope we all have a safe trip.

## Beliefs

### Axiom 1: There is a working mechanism to the universe that is unchangeable by any of its parts.

A good example of such a situation would be if the universe was completely
defined by a Newtonian model. It would be defined by Newton's laws, say, “Force
equals mass times acceleration, ...” and a set of interaction terms that defined
what the forces applying onto any of those particles would be. It would thus
follow, by definition, that none of its particles would have a say on what
really happens to them.

Now, the universe sure as hell doesn't follow Newtonian mechanics. But [we do
have pretty successful models for reality](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model
). And however faulty they may be (at unfathomably high resolution), it doesn't
change the fact that they do limit what we can say happens. We can't say a
planet isn't orbiting the sun. We can't say dopamine doesn't do what we know it
does do.

### Consequence 2: Human behaviour is, fundamentally, outside of its control.

#### From [axiom 1](#axiom-1-there-is-a-working-mechanism-to-the-universe-that-is-unchangeable-by-any-of-its-parts)

Whatever rules they be. Electrons do as electrons do, and there's no sense to
claiming otherwise. And we, humans, aren't an exception. We may be complex, hard
to model or predict, but we aren't above it all, and there's always a mechanism
behind us doing as we do.

#### Jeremy

This is a very graphical example of what I mean by “we aren't in control of
ourselves”. I'm gonna assume a materialistic worldview for this example, since
it's the simplest, but I'll go on to highlight that this worldview doesn't
really matter a lot for this point, since even the worldview in which people
have souls is, to a good degree, consistent with axiom 1.

Picture a particular human, let's call it Jeremy. It all began with the
conjunction of a sperm and an ovule, about which Jeremy had no say, since they
didn't exist to begin with. This conjunction takes DNA from somewhere, which
contains the instructions to make “a Jeremy”. It starts doing its thing on the
mother's womb, at first simply replicating, and then growing and growing. Jeremy
is simply a passive actor here, they can't really do anything nor have any
opinion on what's happening. Factors such as their mother's nutrition slowly
define the way Jeremy develops.

Once Jeremy's out of the womb, they begin making choices, yeah. But *there is an
underlying mechanism to those choices*. Namely, Jeremy has a brain, which was
formed all without their intervention. So at the very beginning of their
existence, nothing about Jeremy was in control of them. Both their environment
and their very own identity precedes *and shapes* their will.

It is the case that Jeremy will then go on and grow. Taking decision as they do,
but all those decisiones are defined by some underlying mechanism. At any given
time, the decision happens in the brain, which has been shaped by the past and
its environment, and all decisiones in the past have happened in the brain,
which has been shaped by... until ultimately, it can all be traced back to a
beginning and an environment on which Jeremy has had no opinion whatsoever.

#### Identity

But the assumption of a materialistic worldview isn't all that important really.
If you want a system with *identity*, it has to *behave as it behaves*. Jeremy
is Jeremy because they behave like Jeremy.

Let's assume, instead of a materialistic worldview, that there are greater
agents at play. Suppose Jeremy has a so called free will that's ruled by
something “greater” than the laws of physics.

This means that, whenever Jeremy ought to make a decision, it is not only their
brain and the physical environment that comes into play, but a *primordial
identity* Jeremy's imbued with affects its decision, allowing them to surpass
the materialistic limitations.

But then again, that's Jeremy we're talking about. You may not be able to
predict the outcome of this decision by looking at their brain, but this
decision is Jeremy's. If this decision were random, independent of Jeremy's
identity, you wouldn't call it free will, would you? so, after all, Jeremy's
can't act against its identity.

The worldview has simply gotten more complex (because of this soul agent) and
potentially less predictable (where there unpredictable forces at play), but
Jeremy is in no control.

Either Jeremy is Jeremy, and this defines a mechanism by which Jeremy abides, or
Jeremy is a random force of the aether.

<!--

Intellegibility doesn't follow from axiom 1, so it may be an axiom.
The interaction conceptualization doesn't follow from intellegibility either, I
think, so it may have to be another axiom.
I believe from those, the subjectivity of morale should follow. Bring this to
debate.
I believe the “we are in some degree of control” requires those axioms to be
definable, since the control we appear to have comes from looking at the brain
as a subsystem interacting with the rest.
