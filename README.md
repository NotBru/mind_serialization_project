# Bru's Mind Serialization Project

Lots of people, me included, would love to believe our ideas are consistent,
definite, and unbiased. However, that's hardly the case, for many reasons:
* We construct our world views through a mixture of experience and information.
  Both of those are always subjected to a non-zero degree of lack of knowledge,
  so that we can't (or rather, shouldn't) attribute an absolutely certain value
  of truth to the things we believe in.
  Instead, we must work with [plausible reasoning](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6P1rjJuD_M
  ), so our ideas aren't definite.
* [We don't rewire our whole brain](
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFv5DvrLDCg
  ) each time new information arrives. This would be so mentally demanding and,
  for evolutive purposes, not necessarily benefical.
* I'd hope this would be needless to say, but it isn't:
  We have [hundreds of biases](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
  ).

However, some of us do make an effort to reduce those (hopefully) undesirable
qualities. To this end, I decided to try to slowly write down my worldview,
including morals and whatnot and, while I'm at it, maybe throw some ideas,
insights, or questions that may hopefully appeal to someone. That's the purpose
of this repo.

This README shall contain a list of assertions and, when needed, a quantifier of
my degree of belief in them. I shall make an effort of being explicit with
dependencies, so that it is clear whenever I think a certain position can be
deduced from previous ones.

Welcome to Bru's Mind Serialization Project! I hope we all have a safe trip.

## Definition of done

A properly defined moral, as a set of consistent assertions and beliefs with the
possibility of partial conviction finds its most natural expression in the
language of [probability theory](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf).
HOWEVER, even in the case where this language would suffice, I just can't quite
get to know how sure I'm of everything. Sure I can distinguish absolute
certainty from almost absolute, moderate certainty, and absolute uncertainty.
But how am I to distinguish a 68% certainty from a 68.1% certainty?

The process of structuring this as a Bayesian probability distribution is just
so hard, both conceptually (like, do I even know how to properly assign my
degrees of knowledge? and, can I formally divide the assertions in terms of the
fundamental ones?) and in practice (do I have the time and will?). Sooo, my
definition of done is that it serves to reproduce to a good degree my moral
judgment making.

And most importantly, I'm doing this for fun and to explore the limits of my own
rationality. So... it needn't be completed.

## Beliefs

### Axiom 1: There is a working mechanism to the universe that is unchangeable by any of its parts.

A good example of such a situation would be if the universe was completely
defined by a Newtonian model. It would be defined by Newton's laws, say, “Force
equals mass times acceleration, ...” and a set of interaction terms that defined
what the forces applying onto any of those particles would be. It would thus
follow, by definition, that none of its particles would have a say on what
really happens to them.

Now, the universe sure as hell doesn't follow Newtonian mechanics. But [we do
have pretty successful models for reality](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model
). And however faulty they may be (at unfathomably high resolution), it doesn't
change the fact that they do limit what we can say happens. We can't say a
planet isn't orbiting the sun. We can't say dopamine doesn't do what we know it
does do.

### Consequence 2: Human behaviour is, fundamentally, outside of its control.

#### From [axiom 1](#axiom-1-there-is-a-working-mechanism-to-the-universe-that-is-unchangeable-by-any-of-its-parts)

Whatever rules they be. Electrons do as electrons do, and there's no sense to
claiming otherwise. And we, humans, aren't an exception. We may be complex, hard
to model or predict, but we aren't above it all, and there's always a mechanism
behind us doing as we do.

#### Jeremy

This is a very graphical example of what I mean by “we aren't in control of
ourselves”. I'm gonna assume a materialistic worldview for this example, since
it's the simplest, but I'll go on to highlight that this worldview doesn't
really matter a lot for this point, since even the worldview in which people
have souls is, to a good degree, consistent with axiom 1.

Picture a particular human, let's call it Jeremy. It all began with the
conjunction of a sperm and an ovule, about which Jeremy had no say, since they
didn't exist to begin with. This conjunction takes DNA from somewhere, which
contains the instructions to make “a Jeremy”. It starts doing its thing on the
mother's womb, at first simply replicating, and then growing and growing. Jeremy
is simply a passive actor here, they can't really do anything nor have any
opinion on what's happening. Factors such as their mother's nutrition slowly
define the way Jeremy develops.

Once Jeremy's out of the womb, they begin making choices, yeah. But *there is an
underlying mechanism to those choices*. Namely, Jeremy has a brain, which was
formed all without their intervention. So at the very beginning of their
existence, nothing about Jeremy was in control of them. Both their environment
and their very own identity precedes *and shapes* their will.

It is the case that Jeremy will then go on and grow, making decisions as they
do, but all those decisiones are defined by some underlying mechanism. At any
given time, the decision happens in the brain, which has been shaped by the past
and its environment, and all decisiones in the past have happened in the brain,
which has been shaped by... until ultimately, it can all be traced back to a
beginning and an environment on which Jeremy has had no opinion whatsoever.

#### Identity

But the assumption of a materialistic worldview isn't all that important really.
If you want a system with *identity*, it has to *behave as it behaves*. Jeremy
is Jeremy because they behave like Jeremy.

Let's assume, instead of a materialistic worldview, that there are greater
agents at play. Suppose Jeremy has a so called free will that's ruled by
something “greater” than the laws of physics.

This means that, whenever Jeremy ought to make a decision, it is not only their
brain and the physical environment that comes into play, but a *primordial
identity* Jeremy's imbued with affects its decision, allowing them to surpass
the materialistic limitations.

But then again, that's Jeremy we're talking about. You may not be able to
predict the outcome of this decision by looking at their brain, but this
decision is Jeremy's. If this decision were random, independent of Jeremy's
identity, you wouldn't call it free will, would you? so, after all, Jeremy can't
act against their identity.

The worldview has simply gotten more complex (because of this soul agent) and
potentially less predictable (where there unpredictable forces at play), but
Jeremy is in no control.

Either Jeremy is Jeremy, and this defines a mechanism by which Jeremy abides, or
Jeremy is a random force of the aether.

### Axiom 3: The universe can be explained in terms of subsystems, their self interaction and their mutual interaction

Let's take for example a universe with just a planet and an orbiting moon. This
universe can be obviously divided into two mutually exclusive subsystems, the
aforementioned ones. We can describe the dynamics of the whole universe as a
term describing how the planet behaves by itself, how it interacts with the
moon, and how the moon interacts with itself.

This axiom is meant to state, whenever we divide the universe into mutually
exclusive parts, we can describe the whole dynamics in terms of how each part
interacts with itself and with each of the rest of parts.

Although not stated in the title, it is also implicit that whenever two systems
are alike, their self-interaction dynamics are alike. And whenever two pairs
of systems are alike, their interaction dynamics are alike too.

Say, a perfect copy of something is gonna act all the same, and so forth...

A more complete axiom would state “[core theory](
https://www.atheismandthecity.com/2016/12/the-argument-from-core-theory.html
) is sufficient to properly describe all of human experience”, and since this
theory has the currently described axiom incorporated, it would follow. But for
now I'd rather have the broadest possible axioms come first.

### Consequence 4: Human morals are subjective

#### From [axiom 3](#axiom-3-the-universe-can-be-explained-in-terms-of-subsystems-their-self-interaction-and-their-mutual-interaction)

What's important from the previous axiom is that things are happening and that's
the most objective we can get. Planets orbit each other alright, and we can
understand that's just happening. No more, no less.

But the whole deal is that even the complicated stuff is “just happening”.
Whether we'd rather something didn't happen, say, we think badly of it... it's
just gonna happen.

#### On human morals

So, you may not like a society where human sacrifices were naturalized, but
there's no fundamental power or law forbiding those. You may, since it is
something that can happen, intervene in order for the rest of the world to
follow your moral understanding closer.

That's what we all kinda do, actually. Since there's a good degree of agreement,
we combine efforts to make majoritary moral understandings (as weighted by
actual enforcing power) fulfilled. I indeed totally agree with this. But any
claim to superiority of said morals is simply a misunderstanding of facts:
they're “superior” simply in terms of being preferred by most people.

Gross disagreements are fairly enlightening of this. Take abortion for instance.
Currently, Argentinian votes on its legality were more or less divided at 50/50,
and you have very large pools of population either thinking it is morally right
or it is morally wrong. Is any one of those “more correct” than the others?
hardly. I have a preferred stance, but I cannot claim to draw this stance from
any objective fact of nature.

### Consequence 5: There is a sense in which we do have control over ourselves

#### From [axiom 3](#axiom-3-the-universe-can-be-explained-in-terms-of-subsystems-their-self-interaction-and-their-mutual-interaction)

Even though [consequence 2](#consequence-2-human-behaviour-is-fundamentally-outside-of-its-control)
clearly states that we are governed by rules that are above us, human experience
features a notion of control. This comes from the fact that, since we experience
the universe from within “the shell”, we don't actually know nor perceive the
universe in its entirety. We see people (subsystems) and their interactions with
each other and with the environment.

In this interaction, we can see people's decisions making changes both to their
environment and to themselves. It's not like we can claim “aah, it's just the
universe's doing” and excuse our behaviours or let our brains and bodies rot.
It's a choice, it's a perfectly valid choice, but from this standpoint, we're
to a certain degree in control of said choice.

So, the illusion (and useful heuristic) of ourselves having control arises when
we place ourselves in our own shoes, one of those many subsystems, that
experiences the world with some parts of the brain and makes decision with
other parts, having those two connected.
